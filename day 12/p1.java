// Imagine you are navigating a maze where each path you take has a section with a 
// code. The maze is structured as a series of interconnected rooms, 
// represented as a tree structure. Each room in the maze has a code (integral value)
// associated with it, and you are trying to check if a given sequence of code 
// matches a valid path from the entrance to an exit. 

// You are provide with the maze structure, where you have to build the maze and then,
// you are provided with a series of space seperated digits, representing a journey 
// starting from the entrance and passing through the rooms along the way. 
// The task is to verify whether the path corresponding to this array of codes 
// exists in the maze.

// Example 1:
// Input:
// 0 1 0 0 1 0 -1 -1 1 0 0         //maze structure
// 0 1 0 1                         //path to verify

// Output: true

// Explanation:
//                0
//              /   \
//             1     0
//            / \    /
//           0   1  0
//            \  / \
//             1 0  0

// The given path 0 → 1 → 0 → 1 is a valid path in the maze. 
// Other valid sequences in the maze include 0 → 1 → 1 → 0 and 0 → 0 → 0.


// Example 2:
// Input:
// 1 2 3
// 1 2 3

// output: false

// Explanation:
// The proposed path 1 → 2 → 3 does not exist in the maze, 
// so it cannot be a valid path.
